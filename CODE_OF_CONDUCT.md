# Community Guidelines

On here we value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Not engaging in demeaning, derogatory, rude, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or
  physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and
disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be
disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the
behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and
easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is
threatening or harassing, report it to the organizer or project manager. 
We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Reporting problems

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.
We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported
incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the
report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is
taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the
report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as
ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without
notice.
